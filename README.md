# CreditRisk
#### This project focuses on developing a credit risk model using the Random Forest algorithm, leveraging a comprehensive dataset from financial repositories. The goal is to assess applicant creditworthiness based on various factors like income, credit history, and employment status. The model distinguishes between low and high-risk applicants with high accuracy. Emphasis is placed on interpretability, with feature importance analysis aiding in understanding risk factors. The project aims to provide financial institutions with a reliable tool for informed lending decisions, mitigating loan default risks effectively.
